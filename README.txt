This is a Lua module that wraps a javascript library SyntaxHighlighter
by Alex Gorbatchev. The original library is at http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/
This module also adds a Lua "brush".

Please note that this Lua module is not meant to provide a Lua API for actual
syntax highlighting but rather for getting the text of the javascript code for
sending it to the client.

This module was originally a part of Sputnik project (http://spu.tnik.org)
but is now being split into its own repository.
